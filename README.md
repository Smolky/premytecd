HL7 CDA Export module

## Introduction
The clinical history is the set of documents that contain data, assessments and information of any kind, on the situation and clinical evolution of a patient throughout the care process. The clinical history is constituted by the set of documents, both written and graphic, that refer to the episodes of health and illness of a person, and to the health activity generated by these episodes.

HL7 International is a SDO (Standards Developing Organization, SDO) for the health domain which developes the **CDA HL7: (Clinical Document Architecture)**, an XML-based markup standard intended to specify the encoding, structure and semantics of clinical documents for exchange.

CDA specifies the syntax and supplies a framework for specifying the full semantics of a clinical document, defined by six characteristics:
- Persistence
- Stewardship
- Potential for authentication
- Context
- Wholeness
- Human readability

The structured part relies on coding systems (such as from SNOMED and LOINC) to represent concepts

## Architecture
The objective of this module is generate CDA HL7 compilant files. These files will used the **SNOMED-CT** terminology which uses specific terms for clinic concepts such as illness, allergies, medications and diagnotics.


## Terminology
- **Snomed-CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine â€“ Clinical Terms)**: Multilingual clinical terminology that allows coding, retrieving, communicating and analyzing clinical data allowing health professionals to represent the information in an adequate, accurate and unambiguous way.

- **LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes)**: Database to identify medical laboratory results. LOINC was created in response to the need to have an electronic database with information for certain clinical data and is publicly available at no cost. The LOINC uses universal code names and identifiers for medical terminology related to the Electronic Health Record
